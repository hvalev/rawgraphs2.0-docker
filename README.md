[Rawgraphs 2.0](https://github.com/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app) is a visualization library for creating beatiful graphics for your data. Please see [the official website](https://app.rawgraphs.io/) for examples. As the title says, it's a docker container suitable for self-hosting. At the moment it is still in beta and unfortunately it doesn't seem to work for x32-bit architectures. Perhaps this will be resolved once a stable version is released.
